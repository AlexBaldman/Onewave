# Onewave
Android App to connect to a Onewheel, read values off of it, and display it with a nice Material UI.

This was on the Google Play Store until it was wrongfully DMCA'ed, but I can't really take on the risk 
of doing anything about it, so it lives here now.

Features:

Widget
Notifications
Material Design UI
Custom Shaping Support
Runs in a Foreground Service

I havent decieded what the hell to do with the paid version yet, I'll either make it free & open source as well, let it die, or
do a patreon thing if enough people want it to continue existing.

TODO: Make this readme more upbeat in the future.
